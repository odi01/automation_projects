# Scripts That Make My Life Easier
## 1 - Autofill Form Using OCR
### Using Python AI module to open a web page using Selenium and autofill a form that required reCaptcha.
The form is requiring you to prove that you aren't a robot by typing in a text that appears as an image. <br />
To solve this problem I've used the Pytesseract module to convert an image to text using an OCR method.

To run this script you'll need to install the following modules: <br />
Selenium <br />
Requests <br />
Pillow <br />
Pytesseract <br />

## 2 - WhatsApp Auto Send Love Emojis
### This program is used to open WhatsApp Web and send a love emojis to your loved one at defined time range.
The script requires a phone number input but with a simple code change you can make the phone number predefined. <br />
The script also uses random emojis (three at max) from a list to send each time and random minutes to make it more versatile and hard to detect.

To run this script you'll need to install the following modules: <br />
pywhatkit
