# Scripts That Make My Life Easier
## 1 - Autofill Form Using OCR
### Using Python AI module and Selenium to open a web page and autofill a form that required reCaptcha.
The form is requiring you to prove that you aren't a robot by typing in a text that appears as an image. <br />
To solve this problem I've used the Pytesseract module to convert an image to text using an OCR method.

To run this script you'll need to install the following modules: <br />
Selenium <br />
Requests <br />
Pillow <br />
Pytesseract <br />

## 2 - WhatsApp Auto Send Love Emojis
### This program is used to open WhatsApp Web and send a love emojis to your loved one at defined time range.
The script requires a phone number input but with a simple code change you can make the phone number predefined. <br />
The script also uses random emojis (three at max) from a list to send each time and random minutes to make it more versatile and hard to detect. <br />
BTW there is an exe file in the folder in order to allow people that don't know Python to use the script.

To run this script you'll need to install the following modules: <br />
pywhatkit
